<a href="https://cdunn2.github.io/project3/">Link to our app</a>
    <p>
        1. Our app asks the user to search for a Pokemon, then displays their potential moves at the bottom of the page
        as links. Once one of the "moves" is clicked on, songs with that move as their name will be displayed, along with links to their spotify URL.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Our project fulfills the requirements of this project because:
            - It is deployed on GitHub as a public page
            - It responds to the users imput through entering and clicking
            - It uses the Pokemon API and the Spotify API
            - Has a search for the inputted Pokemon
            - Displays both the results of Pokemon moves and the results of the Spotify search
            - Our project is inheritly filterable by the Pokemon type, and in addition we made the songs
                sortable  by alphabetization.
